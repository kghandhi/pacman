{- A note from Abe and Kira: we did not write this module,

{-| A Triggers record describes on what events you would like to receive
    a Properties record -}

    set to False. -}

    audio function was fired.

{-| A Builder Record is used to desribe how audio should be treated.
    src - The Path to an audio file
    triggers - A Triggers Record describing on which events we want to receive Properties
    propertiesHandler - A Function that is called each time Properties are calculated.
    actions - A Signal of incomming actions that manipulate the audio -}
